# How to Add Badge Icons - SUPER SIMPLE GUIDE

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: You Need SVG Icon Files First!

**Do you have SVG icon files already?**
- If YES → Skip to "Step 2: Copy Your Files"
- If NO → You need to CREATE or GET SVG icon files first (see below)

## Step 1: Get Your SVG Icon Files

You need to have SVG icon files for each badge. Here are your options:

### Option A: You Already Have SVG Files
- Maybe a designer gave them to you?
- Maybe they're in a ZIP file?
- Maybe they're in another folder on your computer?

**Where are they?** Tell me and I'll help you move them.

### Option B: You Need to Create Them
- Use a design tool (Figma, Illustrator, etc.)
- Or hire a designer
- Or use an icon library and customize them

### Option C: Use Placeholder Icons (For Testing)
I can create a simple script that generates placeholder SVG files for testing.

## Step 2: Copy Your Files to the Folders

Once you have SVG files, here's how to put them in the right place:

### Method 1: Drag and Drop (Easiest!)

1. **Open File Explorer** (Windows key + E)
2. **Navigate to your project:**
   ```
   C:\Users\Catman Freeman\Desktop\client\badges
   ```
3. **Open the folder where your SVG files are** (in another window)
4. **Drag and drop** each SVG file into the correct subfolder:
   - Files starting with `foh_` → drag to `badges\foh\`
   - Files starting with `boh_` → drag to `badges\boh\`
   - Files starting with `valet_` → drag to `badges\valet\`
   - Files starting with `diner_` → drag to `badges\diner\`
   - Files starting with `mgmt_` or `restaurant_` or `company_` → drag to `badges\management\`

### Method 2: Copy and Paste

1. **Right-click** on your SVG file
2. **Select "Copy"**
3. **Navigate to:** `C:\Users\Catman Freeman\Desktop\client\badges\[folder]`
4. **Right-click** in the folder
5. **Select "Paste"**

## Step 3: Verify Files Are in the Right Place

After copying, your structure should look like:

```
badges/
  ├── foh/
  │   ├── foh_five_star_service.svg    ← Your file here
  │   ├── foh_guest_favorite.svg       ← Your file here
  │   └── ... (more files)
  ├── boh/
  │   ├── boh_grill_master.svg          ← Your file here
  │   └── ... (more files)
  └── ... (other folders)
```

## What Are You Looking At Right Now?

**Please tell me:**
1. Do you have SVG files already? (Yes/No)
2. If yes, where are they? (What folder/path?)
3. Are you trying to click on something? (What file/folder?)

Once I know what you're looking at, I can give you exact instructions!
